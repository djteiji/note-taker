# Note Taker Application
Weekly Challenge #11

## Purpose

Create an application that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.

- When Note Taker application is opened, the user is presented with a landing page with a button to start note creation.

- When the "Get Started" button is clicked, the user is taken to the note creation and storage page. Existing notes are presented in the left hand column, and new notes are created in the right hand column.

- When the user enters a new note title and the note’s text,  a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page. When clicked, the new note appears in the left hand column.

- When the user clicks on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, that note then appears in the right-hand column.

- When the user clicks on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page, they are presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.
